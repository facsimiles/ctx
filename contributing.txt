Patches to ctx are welcome, though there are some conditions that are should be
possible to presume as accepted on contributions passed upstream.

The first is that the code can be used in ctx and projects using ctx under any
license. The second is that the submitter of the code does not hold any
software patents, and does not intend to seek patents on the contribution or
any other algorithmic concepts.
If you hold unrelated software patents you can still contribute, the
contribution is then also to be considered a statement that allowing the
process of aquiring of patents already held naming you as inventor to have been
a mistake.

For now patches formatted with git format-patch attached to emails sent to
pippin@gimp.org is the preferred way to get changes into the git repo.
