<h1 id='mcu'>microcontroller tests</h1> <p>To keep code size small and
constraining development of ctx from the beginning has been the ability to use
it for antialiased resolution independent user interfaces on microcontrollers;
the first prototyping board was card10.
If you have your own retained scene-graph/widget tree, or use immediate-mode-gui
approaches; ctx can be used to render the scene in chunks/scanlines permitting
larger displays to be driven from microcontrollers. With more RAM at disposal
and some subtexture update capable LCD/OLED displays and eink, using the
drawlist for storing drawing commands becomes possible - as well as the hash-caching capability to reduce inter-frame redraw and recomputations.
</p>

<p>
The performance of ctx has increased since these video were made, and making
more use of RGBA8 directly in small bands is preferable to working in RGB565
like these demos did. New iterations of demos are planned, and the codesize of
ctx with full HTML5 canvas API support fits modern microcontrollers, the
codesize can be as small as 28kb + 20kb (ascii font) of footprint and needing
as little as 5kb at runtime. (Addendum 2024) a really minimal build in terms of
code size has not been done in a while and ctx currently clocks in at 64-128kb
for a small build; RAM requirements remain small.</p>

<p>
The arm-cortex-m4 at 97mhz in the card10 badge and on the TTGO ESP32 both with
immediate rendering, the card10 has a 180x80 display with really high visual
quality, while the TFT LCD on the ESP32 has slightly higher pixel resolution at
160x128, video from november 2019. Usage of ctx for rendering the existing
graphics API but with antialiasing has landed <a

the following camp badges <a href='https://flow3r.garden/'>flow3r</a> and <a href='https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/'>tildagon</a>- had a ctx
renderers when hardware was publicly available.

<p>january 2020, a demo running on an esp with 320x240 <tt>RGB565</tt> display, here the
framebuffer is larger than the biggest single allocation we can afford and the
deferred rendering is rendering the display in 4 chunks.</p>

With little geometry this is fine; with more the displays starts
having very visible tearing on large content changes.
